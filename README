# Learing Godot Progject: Get Out!

Create a simple 2D game where the Player tries to reach an Exit (gap in
the surrounding walls) before being caught by an Enemy.

> Best viewed with `glow README`

## Task 001: controllable player
- [x] 2D controllable sprite (WASD = NWSE), top-down view
  - [x] Add NE, NW, SE, SW when 2 keys are pressed

## Task 002: add game arena border with Exit
- [x] Add a surrounding border with a gap for an "Exit". Add a collision object
  for the gap and if player touches the Exit, they win.

### NOTE: Collision layers
* Player: Layer 1, Mask 2(Walls), 3(Enemy)
* Walls:  Layer 2, Mask None(Walls usually don't "look" for things)
* Enemy:  Layer 3, Mask 1(Player), 2(Walls)
* Exit:   Layer None, Mask 1(Only looking for Player)

## Task 003: add hostile npc to chase player
- [x] Add a slower moving NPC that chases the player. Player must reach the EXIT
  before being caught.
  - [ ] Add a score that increments each EXIT is reached. Lose the game if caught.
  - [x] When facing the NPC, it stops (think Mario and ghosts), with a short delay
        before resuming the chase. The Enemy also changes color to blue.
  - [ ] Each iteration (after EXITing), the NPC speeds up.

## Task 004: add game UI
- [ ] Add a UI (Start, Exit, Help, Credits)

## Task 005: add sound effects
- [ ] Add sounds and background music

## Task 006: Improvements
- [x] Change Player, Enemy, and Wall into distinct scenes (vs Main scene only)
- [ ] Change Enemey from `CharacterBody2D` to `NavigationAgent2D` 
- [ ] Node communication via signals vs references (remove get_parent(), etc)

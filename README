# Learing Godot Progject: Get Out!

* 2D controllable sprite (WASD = NWSE), top-down view
  * Add NE, NW, SE, SW when 2 keys are pressed

* Add a slower moving NPC that tries to catch you. You must reach the EXIT before being caught.
  * Add a score that increments each EXIT is reached. Lose the game if caught.
  * When facing the NPC, it stops (think Mario and ghosts), with a short delay before resuming the chase.
  * Each iteration (after EXITing), the NPC speeds up.

* Add a UI (Start, Exit, Help, Credits)

* Add sounds and background music

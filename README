# Learing Godot Progject: Get Out!

Create a simple 2D game where the Player tries to reach an Exit (gap in
the surrounding walls) before being caught by an Enemy.

## Task 001: controllable player
- 2D controllable sprite (WASD = NWSE), top-down view
  - Add NE, NW, SE, SW when 2 keys are pressed

## Task 002: add game arena border with Exit
- Add a surrounding border with a gap for an "Exit". Add a collision object for
  the gap and if player touches the Exit, they win.

## Task 003: add hostile npc to chase player
- Add a slower moving NPC that chases the player. Player must reach the EXIT
  before being caught.
  * Add a score that increments each EXIT is reached. Lose the game if caught.
  * When facing the NPC, it stops (think Mario and ghosts), with a short delay
    before resuming the chase.
  * Each iteration (after EXITing), the NPC speeds up.

## Task 004: add game UI
* Add a UI (Start, Exit, Help, Credits)

## Task 005: add sound effects
